Welcome! I'm Sofie Flom, and I'm a third-year Environmental Studies B.S. student at UC Santa Barbara. I am currently interested in many fields in Environmental Studies, including ecology, social justice, renewable energy, and GIS. I am considering a career in GIS and will be an intern in the BEL Program this summer! 

Beyond studying, I spend a lot of time outdoors and playing sports. I am currently on the UCSB Women's Rugby team, and I also enjoy playing soccer, surfing, hiking, and spending time at the beach.
