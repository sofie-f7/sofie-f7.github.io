I am considering a career in GIS and will be an intern in the BEL Program this summer!\nBeyond studying, I spend a lot of time outdoors and playing sports. I am currently on the UCSB Women’s Rugby team, and I also enjoy playing soccer, surfing, hiking, and spending time at the beach."

    "text": "Outside of academics, I love being outside and playing sports.\n\n\n\nI play for the UCSB Women’s Rugby team! I have been on the team for one year, and plan on continuing next year as Outreach officer. My current positions are wing and scrumhalf.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also play soccer! I started when I was 4 years old and mostly played club soccer, in addition to playing on my high school team. Here at UCSB, I play on an intermural team. This is a picture of my brother and me at a River Plate game in Argentina!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love surfing and spending time at the beach in my freetime. I taught at a surf camp in Malibu for two years, and before that I was a camper there for awhile. The beach is one of the reasons why I love UCSB."
