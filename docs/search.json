I am currently interested in many fields in Environmental Studies, including ecology, social justice, renewable energy, and GIS. I am considering a career in GIS and will be an intern in the BEL Program this summer!\nBeyond studying, I spend a lot of time outdoors and playing sports. I am currently on the UCSB Women’s Rugby team, and I also enjoy playing soccer, surfing, hiking, and spending time at the beach."

    "text": "In my Statistics for Environmental Science class, I created a line graph visualizing EPA data on particulate matter during the Thomas Fire for one of my assignments. In 2017-2018, this fire burned 281,893 acres in Ventura County and Santa Barbara County, starting on December 4th and being fully contained on January 12, 2018.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) #read in tidyverse package\n\nsbpm &lt;- read_csv(\"sbpm_copy.csv\") #read in Canvas data\n\nAbove, I am reading in my data and the packages that are necessary to create the plot that I want.\n\nggplot(data = sbpm, #data comes from the sbpm dataframe\n       aes(x = date, #make the x-axis the date\n           y = pm2_5, #make the y-axis the PM2.5 data\n           color = local_site_name, #color each line by the location of the sensor\n           shape = local_site_name)) + #each line/location should have a different shape to be redundant\n    geom_point() + #adds points\n    geom_line() + #adds the line\n    labs(x = \"Date\", #renames x-axis\n         y = \"PM2.5\", #renames y-axis\n         color = \"Location\", #relabelling the legend\n         shape = \"Location\") #labelling the legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the plot I created. The different colors represent different locations where the particulate matter (PM2.5) was measured. The purpose of this line graph is to visualize the changes in PM2.5 through the timeline of the fire, and to compare PM2.5 levels at different locations."

    "text": "I created this interactive map during my internship at Heal the Bay during the summmer of 2024. I was inspired to do this project after learning in one of my classes about the actual amount of recycling material that gets recycled in the U.S. once it is thrown away. After bringing this idea to my mentor, she mentioned that there are 88 cities in LA County, and each city actually has its own slightly different recycling and organic waste policies. I spent time familiarizing myself with the software of Google MyMaps and figuring out the most effective way to compile data for 88 cities. For each city, I searched google for its recycling and composting policies, then uploaded the spreadsheet of this information onto my map."

    "text": "Outside of academics, I love being outside and playing sports.\n\n\n\nI play for the UCSB Women’s Rugby team! I have been on the team for one year, and plan on continuing next year as Outreach officer. My current positions are wing and scrumhalf.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also play soccer! I started when I was 4 years old and mostly played club soccer, in addition to playing on my high school team. Here at UCSB, I play on an intermural team. This is a picture of my brother and me at a River Plate game in Argentina!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love surfing and spending time at the beach in my freetime. I taught at a surf camp in Malibu for two years, and before that I was a camper there for awhile. The beach is one of the reasons why I love UCSB."
